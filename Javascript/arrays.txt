Important array method used in javascript.

-> sort() -> The sort() method is a built-in function in JavaScript that rearranges the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

Return value:

The same array, but now sorted.

Key Points

sort() modifies the original array; it does not create a new array.

If a compare function is provided, it decides the order using these rules:

Return negative → first element comes before the second

Return positive → first element comes after the second

Return 0 → order stays the same

Works for numbers, strings, and objects.

5️⃣ Important point

The key is:

Negative → first element stays first

Positive → second element moves before the first

Zero → no change

This allows sort() to work for numbers, strings, and objects in a consistent way.
