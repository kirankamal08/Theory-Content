Ques:- What is Event Delegation ?
And: - Event delegation is a JavaScript pattern that allows you to handle events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of 
attaching separate listeners to multiple similar (ex - li) child elements.

The event listener on the parent “delegates” the handling to the appropriate child element based on which element triggered the event.

It works because of event bubbling, where events propagate (bubble) from the target element up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.


Key Points:

Attach listener to a parent: Instead of adding listeners to every child, add it to a common parent.

Use event.target: Inside the handler, check which child element actually triggered the event.

Efficient and dynamic: Works even for elements added dynamically after the listener is set.


Example:

// HTML
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

// JavaScript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

menu.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    alert(`You clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});


✅ Here’s what happens:

-> Only one event listener is attached to <ul>.

-> When you click any <li>, the event bubbles up to <ul>.

-> event.target tells us which <li> was clicked.

✅ Benefits of event delegation:

Fewer event listeners → better performance, especially for large lists.

Handles dynamically added elements automatically.

Keeps code cleaner and easier to maintain.

1. Event Propagation Phase:

When an event occurs in the DOM, it goes through three phases:

1) Capturing phase (trickling down):

-> The event starts from the window/document and moves down the DOM tree toward the target element.
-> Rarely used, but you can listen during this phase by passing { capture: true } to addEventListener.

2) Target phase

The event has reached the target element (the actual element that was interacted with).

3) Bubbling phase (bubbling up)

The event bubbles up from the target element through its ancestors to the document.

Most common phase for event delegation.

2. How Event Delegation Uses Bubbling

Event delegation relies on bubbling:

-> You attach a single listener to a parent element.

-> When a child element triggers the event, it bubbles up to the parent.

-> The parent’s listener can inspect event.target to determine which child was interacted with.

Example:

// Example: Delegation relies on bubbling
const parent = document.getElementById('parent');

parent.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('Clicked element:', event.target);
});


Here:

Even if you click a nested <button> inside parent, the click event bubbles up, so the parent’s listener can catch it.

If bubbling didn’t exist, delegation wouldn’t work.

3. What about capturing?

Technically, delegation could work with capturing, but it’s almost never used.

Capturing would mean the parent catches the event on the way down, before the target element.

Since you usually want to know exactly which child triggered the event, bubbling is more natural.
