1) what is Hot and cold obeservable in Angular

🔹 1. Cold Observables

A Cold Observable is one that starts producing values only when a subscriber subscribes.
Each subscriber gets its own independent execution of the observable.

👉 Think of it like watching a YouTube video:

Every person watches the video from the beginning when they hit play.

Each viewer has their own playback; pausing/playing doesn’t affect others.

Characteristics:

Producer starts emitting when subscribe() is called.

Each subscription gets a fresh sequence of values.

Useful for things like HTTP requests, file reading, timers.


import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const cold$ = new Observable(observer => {
  console.log('Observable started');
  observer.next(Math.random()); // generates a random number
  observer.complete();
});

cold$.subscribe(val => console.log('Subscriber 1:', val));
cold$.subscribe(val => console.log('Subscriber 2:', val));


Output

Observable started
Subscriber 1: 0.42351  // different number
Observable started
Subscriber 2: 0.89234  // different number


🔹 2. Hot Observables

A Hot Observable is one that produces values independent of subscriptions.
Subscribers share the same execution and can “join in the middle.”

👉 Think of it like a live cricket match on TV:

The game is happening whether you watch or not.

If you tune in late, you only see what’s happening now — you missed earlier events.

Characteristics:

Producer emits values even without subscribers.

All subscribers share the same source.

Useful for things like user events, WebSocket connections, mouse movements, real-time streams.

import { interval } from 'rxjs';

const hot$ = interval(1000); // emits increasing numbers every second

hot$.subscribe(val => console.log('Subscriber 1:', val));

setTimeout(() => {
  hot$.subscribe(val => console.log('Subscriber 2:', val));
}, 3000);


Subscriber 1: 0
Subscriber 1: 1
Subscriber 1: 2
Subscriber 2: 2   // joins in late, starts seeing current values
Subscriber 1: 3
Subscriber 2: 3
Subscriber 1: 4
Subscriber 2: 4


✅ The observable is already “hot” — Subscriber 2 misses the first 3 values because the source was already running.


-> Let’s break down why shareReplay prevents a new HTTP request, even if two different subscribers subscribe.

🔹 First, Why Multiple HTTP Requests Happen Normally?

     this.http.get('/api/users');

🔹 HttpClient.get() returns a cold observable.

🔹 Every time you subscribe(), it creates a new execution → new HTTP request.


this.userService.getUsers().subscribe(...); // request 1
this.userService.getUsers().subscribe(...); // request 2


Two subscriptions = two network calls 🚨

🔹 What shareReplay Does

shareReplay is an RxJS operator that:

Shares a single execution among multiple subscribers.

 🔹 Internally, it uses multicasting (like turning a unicast → broadcast).

Replays the last emitted value to new subscribers (so late subscribers don’t trigger new execution).

Uses reference counting to manage the subscription to the source observable.

🔧 Step-by-step with your HTTP request

Service code:


this.users$ = this.http.get('/api/users').pipe(
  shareReplay(1)
);


First subscriber:

1) subscribe() is called.

2) Since no active subscription exists yet, shareReplay subscribes to the source observable (http.get).

3) HTTP request is made ✅

4) Response is emitted → cached inside shareReplay.

Second subscriber:

Another subscribe() is called.

1) This time, shareReplay sees it already has an active execution and cached value.

2) It does NOT re-subscribe to the source observable.

3) It just replays the cached value to the new subscriber.

✅ Result: Both subscribers share the same HTTP response. Only one request is made.


🔹 Quick Example (Logging Proof)

const users$ = this.http.get('/api/users').pipe(
  tap(() => console.log('HTTP executed')), // log when actual request happens
  shareReplay(1)
);

users$.subscribe(data => console.log('Subscriber 1:', data));
users$.subscribe(data => console.log('Subscriber 2:', data));


HTTP executed
Subscriber 1: [...]
Subscriber 2: [...]

🚨 Without shareReplay, you’d see:

HTTP executed
Subscriber 1: [...]
HTTP executed
Subscriber 2: [...]


🔹  Unicast vs Multicast

Unicast (default Observable): each subscriber gets its own execution.

Multicast (Subjects): one producer, many consumers share the same values.

🔹  Subscription lifecycle

🔹  Start: subscribe()


RxJS Operators:


map, switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, filter, debounceTime, takeUntil.

🔹 1. map

What it does: Transforms each emitted value into another value.

Analogy: Like applying a function to every item in an array (Array.map).

Use case: Convert HTTP response to a required format.

🔹 2. switchMap

What it does: Maps to an inner observable, cancels the previous one when a new value arrives.

Analogy: Like switching TV channels — only the latest channel plays, old ones are stopped.

Use case: Typeahead search (cancel old HTTP requests if user types again).

import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { debounceTime, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';

fromEvent(document, 'keyup').pipe(
  debounceTime(500),
  switchMap(event => ajax.getJSON(`/api/search?q=${event.key}`))
).subscribe(console.log);
